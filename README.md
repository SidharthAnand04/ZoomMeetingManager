###Project Overview: Zoom Meeting Manager with Flask and Twilio Integration
The Zoom Meeting Manager is a Python-based application that allows users to manage their Zoom meetings using simple text commands via Twilio’s messaging service. This tool enables users to list, create, and delete Zoom meetings by sending predefined commands, offering a streamlined alternative to navigating through the Zoom app interface. The program leverages Flask for routing and handling requests, the Zoom API for meeting management, and Twilio’s API for SMS-based interaction, making it an accessible solution for users on mobile devices or those who prefer quick text-based commands.

###Algorithm Explanation
The core functionality of this project is built around three main tasks:

Authentication and Setup: The program begins by loading API credentials (API Key, Secret, and User Email) from environment variables to securely connect to the Zoom API. The ZoomClient from the Zoom SDK is initialized with these credentials, allowing the app to interact with the user’s Zoom account.

User Commands and Text-Based Interaction: Users interact with the application by sending text messages through Twilio. The incoming messages are received by Flask and parsed to determine the desired action:

List Meetings: When the user inputs a command like "1" or "List Meetings," the application fetches and displays all scheduled meetings for the authenticated user. It includes essential meeting details such as the topic, ID, start time, and URL, helping users quickly access information.
Create a Meeting: If the user chooses to create a meeting by sending "2" or "Create Meeting," the application guides them through a series of prompts, requesting details like the start time, topic, and duration. Once all details are received, a new meeting is created on the user’s Zoom account. The tool then confirms the creation by providing the meeting link, topic, and other details.
Delete a Meeting: By inputting "3" or "Delete Meeting," users can remove a meeting by providing its unique ID. The application checks the meeting's existence and confirms its deletion if successful.
Meeting Management Workflow:

Regex Validation for Input: A regex pattern is used to validate date and time inputs, ensuring they are in the correct format (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss). This check is crucial for creating a meeting, as it prevents errors in scheduling due to incorrect date formatting.
Time Zone Conversion: The app includes functionality to convert meeting times between time zones using the pytz library. This feature is particularly useful for users who may be scheduling meetings across different time zones, as it automatically adjusts the time according to the user’s settings.
Session Management: The Flask session object is utilized to track user inputs during the multi-step process of creating or deleting a meeting. This session handling ensures that the user’s input flow is maintained correctly, even if messages are sent in multiple steps.
###Inspiration
This project was inspired by the need for a simplified method of managing Zoom meetings, particularly for users who are frequently on the move or prefer using SMS commands rather than navigating through apps. The concept of integrating Zoom’s API with SMS-based interaction via Twilio provides an innovative approach, making it possible for users to manage meetings directly from their mobile devices without needing the Zoom app or even a web browser. This is ideal for quick scheduling, last-minute changes, and on-the-go accessibility.

###Comparison to Manual and Human Interaction
Efficiency: The Zoom Meeting Manager significantly reduces the steps required to schedule or manage meetings compared to traditional methods. Instead of navigating multiple menus within the Zoom app, users can accomplish these tasks with simple text commands.

User Experience: By offering SMS-based commands, the application provides an intuitive experience similar to texting, which most users are familiar with. This is especially useful for non-technical users who may find it easier to follow text prompts rather than navigating complex interfaces.

Reliability: The application is built to handle common scheduling tasks and includes error handling for invalid inputs (such as incorrect time formats or non-existent meeting IDs). While human scheduling assistants may offer more flexibility in understanding nuanced or non-standard requests, this application excels at quickly processing structured commands.

Accessibility: This solution is accessible from any mobile device that can send and receive SMS messages, making it a versatile tool for users in environments where accessing the Zoom app may not be possible. It’s especially valuable for users who travel frequently, as it allows them to manage meetings from virtually anywhere.

###Summary
Overall, the Zoom Meeting Manager provides a unique and efficient solution for managing Zoom meetings via SMS, bringing together Flask, the Zoom API, and Twilio’s messaging capabilities. By focusing on accessibility and ease of use, the application makes it simple for users to handle meeting scheduling tasks with minimal friction. This project demonstrates a practical approach to meeting management and opens the door to further enhancements, such as adding meeting reminders or integrating with calendar services, to expand its capabilities and improve productivity.
